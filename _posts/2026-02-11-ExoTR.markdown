ExoTR (Exoplanetary Transmission Retrieval) is an open-source Bayesian atmospheric
retrieval framework for interpreting exoplanet transmission spectra. It combines a
forward model of planetary atmospheres with Bayesian inference to estimate
atmospheric properties from observed spectra, enabling robust constraints on
composition and structure.
